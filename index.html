                <h2>The Marshall Mathers LP:</h2>
                <p>Released in 2000, this album is the third studio album by American rapper Eminem. To this day it is regarded as one of the top Hip-hop albums of all time. Despite having songs like "Stan" and "The Real Slim Shady", one of the rawest songs on the album is "The Way I Am" and it is my favorite.</p>

                <h2>The Eminem Show</h2>
                <p>Released in 2002, this album is the fourth studio album by American rapper Eminem. This album is still regarded as his best work and rightly so with having songs that all people can jam to like "Sing for the Moment", "Soldier", The ever green "Without Me". But the one song that stands out for me is "Till I Collapse".</p>

                <h2>Encore</h2>
                <p>Released in 2004, this album is the fifth studio album by American rapper Eminem. While it wasn't as good as its ancestor "The Eminem Show" it had it's own wild share of crazy lines only Eminem would say. Despite the controversial lyrics and raps his song "Mockingbird" stands out (many consider it to be his best song).</p>

                <h2>Relapse</h2>
                <p>Released in 2009, this album is the sixth studio album by American rapper Eminem. Eminem took a break after his overdose which nearly killed him. During this time he would spend time with his daughter and get clean. He himself famously states "Encore I was on drugs, Relapse Im flushing them out" signifying changes he went through during the 5 year hiatus. My favourite song from this album is "Beautiful" which is his most heart-touching song till this day.</p>

                <h2>Recovery</h2>
                <p>Released in 2010, this album is the seventh studio album by American rapper Eminem. In this album Eminem talks about his struggles with addiction and his journey to getting clean. Despite not being that loved in hip-hop community this album managed to win him a grammy for the best rap album 2010. The catalogue again has many songs to jam to like "Talking to myself" "Almost Famous" and "love the way yo lie". But his best song on the album is "No Love ft. Lil Wayne", the song was the first collaboration between Wayne and Eminem and it went on to be 3x Platinum.</p>

                <h2>Revival</h2>
                <p>Released in 2017, this album is the eighth studio album by American rapper Eminem. Unlike his previous albums Revival got a lot of hate, critics labelled it as "too political and sampaled". Despite all the hate it still had a great song catalogue and one such is "In Your Head" which is a sample of a famous song "Zombie" by cranberries.</p>

                <h2>Kamikaze</h2>
                <p>Released in 2018, this album is the ninth studio album by American rapper Eminem. Dubbed as a reply to critics on Revival, kamakazee had numerous disses on rappers and celebs. "Lucky You ft. Joyner Lucas" is the stand out song from the album. With both rappers rapping at a fast pace and having consistent rhyme scheme this is a must hear for hip-hop enthusiast.</p>

                <h2>Music to be murdered by</h2>
                <p>Released in 2020, this album is the tenth studio album by American rapper Eminem. Considered to be his most lyrically complex album yet, Music To Be Murdered By (MTBMB) has Eminem flexing his rap muscles. With songs like "Godzilla ft. Juice WRLD" and "Never Love again" his candance and flow is unmatched. My recommendation from this album is "Leaving heaven ft. Skylar Grey".</p>

                <h2>Music to be murdered by Side B</h2>
                <p>Released in 2020, this album is the eleventh studio album by American Eminem. Released as an extension of the original album, this Side B explores a more Grim and darker side with Eminem in both songs and beats. My personal favourite from this album would be "Higher" which has everything from great flow to a catchy and memorable hook.</p>
